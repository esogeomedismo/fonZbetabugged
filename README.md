# fonZ <br>
searches among the installed fonts<br>
and let the user choose<br>
among those found<br>
which one to use<br>
for the website<br>

## but this version beta zero 2 is retired because bugged


### html css javascript <hr>
fonZ for now has 4 files<br>
1 html example page with css embedded for the page and fonZ<br>
2 js one for fonZ application and the other for a list of fonts - only the name<br>
1 image svg optional for the background<br><br>

#### notice - the button X for close don't stops fonZ
### fonZ bug #BB or #1git
when fonZ searches for fonts only the stop button stops fonZ<br>
the close button closes the window<br>
but fonZ continues to run in the background until the search ends  
need fix  
so the close button can be a run in background button  
and a stop and close button is missing
<hr>

## Usage
download the files and put the scripts in a folder named js<br>
and the image in his img folder<br>
or use other names or locations and change the links in the example page<br>
open the example page in a browser and run the script<br>

fonZ can run in any location with or without a webserver<br>
without server fonZ loss some functions and the user cannot save his choice<br>
because fonZ need some cookie for stored the name of fonts found<br>
if it find something<br><br>

## Usage without the example page<br>

put the code at bottom of example page in your page<br>
put the css code of fonZ in a css file or embedd it<br>
link the scripts<br>
done<br><br>

## Add other name fonts<br>

add the names to the script for fonts where are stored the existing fonts and in the same format i.e. 'a fonts','another','serif','etc etc',<br>
for now fonZ support until 324 fonts <br>
but is quite simple enlarge that limit <br>
